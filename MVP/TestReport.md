<p>Integration and Functionality testing were performed to test key areas of our system, though the test plan results show that every module we had developed passed every test accurately achieving
the desired results. This meant that at the end of each deadline for the development of each key module was completed in time while delivering the desired functionality.</p>

<h2>Automatic Testing</h2>
We had performed a limited amount of JUnit tests due to the requirement of an interaction from the GUI, which GUI elements can not be tested through unit testing. Although we had used unit tests to cover large modules
of code such as the parsing of student data into a student table to calculate the low and top boundary's which revealed flaws in the algorithm with extreme data. Another unit test we had written was for the module tables
difficulty algorithm that calculated an easy and hard boundary based on the student data, testing with extreme cases of data enabled for fine-tuning of the algorithm to produce more accurate boundaries. Smaller unit tests were
also written to test for example the reading of data from a data file to ensure it is formatted and stored in a data structure as expected, as well as a test for configuration file where the file path stored as a property is 
correctly retrieved and accessible. Although we strove for 100% unit test coverage, we had covered the majority of our large functions such as the table boundary systems and the filtering of student data for graph systems, however 
many areas of the user interface felt inefficient to cover with unit tests as for instance writing unit tests for action listeners requires interaction with interface component, meaning the action listener behaviour could not be 
tested in our written unit tests. Instead, to test our interface components we relied on functionality testing plans to assess the behaviour of the GUI, and testing the program as it was developed by simply using the interface.
