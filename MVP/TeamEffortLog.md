Report system UI optimisations and improving user-friendliness <br>
<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-109> - Set and completed in sprint 7, it took 3 days. Implementing validation to the report system that warns the user that there are no users found within the selected modules and therefore will be missing data in tables and graphs. Adding headings and subheadings above graphs and tables to illustrate what the data is showing.

Also improve the student performance table by including all data into one dedicated table instead of 3 separate tables in their respective category, to differentiate categories the table can be ordered in ascending order with an additional comments heading that tells what category they have met.

<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-82?filter=-4> 
in Sprint 4, I was assigned to do a Histogram for the sourcecode.GUI I’ve created and then committing and pushing it into the team’s repository.
The issues that were assigned to me during Sprint 4 are:
<br>Histogram for the sourcecode.GUI. Where I will be displaying the student data and performance on a histogram to allow the user to visualize the data on the CSV file. Where I need to create the sourcecode.GUI layout based on my teammate Murtaza's sourcecode.GUI mockups
<br>Describe the functional product. Where I should describe the functionality of the product, such as describing each button and its functions.
<br>In this sprint, I have completed the coding part for the team’s MVP and presented it during the sprint. Where my teammate has worked on reading the CSV file and I completed the sourcecode.GUI and displaying the data as a histogram.

## Murtaza Alishan
<h4>Sprint 1 (University Week 3):</h4>

<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-16> Sprint 1 abled me to familiarise myself with the team
I was placed in. It helped me gain an in-depth understanding of Jira. I prioritised learning how to
create and update issues for myself and the team.
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-18 This issue required me to watch the GitLab intro to
gain a better understanding on how to use Gitlab. I was taught how to push/pull to the code whilst
working alongside a team.

<h4>Sprint 2 (University Week 5):</h4>

<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-20> During sprint 2 my team and I created a collaboration
file, to which we used our knowledge on Gitlab and push/pull to edit this file and make changes. I
coded my own line on IntelliJ and pushed it to the collaboration file on the Git along with my team. I
used these techniques on the helloworld.java file where I added my name to the file.
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-27 During this sprint I also learned how to resolve a
merge conflict. I learnt to remove the conflict notification and update it on the collaborations file

<h4>Sprint 3 (University Week 6-7):</h4>

<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-50> In sprint 3 I translated user proposals into formal user
stories. This was a formal method of recording requirements that the team could follow when coding
the final product. The user stories were created from the perspective of head of department who were
going to make use of the program. User stories were used to create use case diagrams.

<h4>Sprint 4 (University Week 8):</h4>
In sprint 4 I put together mock-up sourcecode.GUI’s so that my teammates could get a better visualisation of how
the final product should aim to look and how it would feel when using it. I used a wireframe
technique to build various designs and we picked the best one for our use-case through the process of
elimination. I did this by pointing out the pros and cons of each design and choosing the one that was
the most viable.

<h4>Sprint 8 (University Week 23):</h4>
In sprint 8, me and the team split and assigned the team report to each other. For this report, I oversaw the marketing plan, focusing on the Competition, the marketing mix and the sales forecast.

https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-120?jql=assignee%20%3D%20currentUser()

I conducted research, learning about each of the three mentioned sectors and the different ways to go about tackling various goals such as the products and services from various companies we would potentially be going against. I looked at what was already available to the mass market and analysed different methods at which we could gain the upper hand within the existing market using techniques such as competitive product pricing and social media product marketing. I researched what features and methods the existing products had & used in order to make sure our product had what the consumers wanted from an education management tool.

https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-118?jql=assignee%20%3D%20currentUser()

I was tasked to go in-depth with our marketing mix and detail the type of product we would be selling to the public. I spoke about the price that we would be aiming to sell our product at which would be competitive in order to reach a larger customer base. I wrote about the various different methods that we could promote our product to the public, using things such as social media. Finally, I spoke about the place where our product would be available. I mentioned using a potential webpage which would allow us to sell our product on a global scale, as well as aiding us in building a brand, giving our product a face as well as establishing credibility in the market.

I also conducted a sales forecast for the product once it goes on sale. This looked at the numbers the product would pull on the market. I listed the amount of free trials the product would do and the growth of the trials tested since the month before. The amount sold along with the price per unit was used to gather information on how much revenue we were looking at for every month.

Through this documentation, the team was able to get a broad idea on the scale of the product, the end goal that we want to achieve through it and how to get there using modern marketing strategies and selling techniques.
