<h1>REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS / USER STORIES</h1>
<br>
<h4>USER STORY 1</h4>
<p>As a professor, I need to be able to make a comparison between
the top, average and poor performing students, so that I can tailor my lectures
to those who are under performing.</p>

<p>This story has yet to be assigned to someone and has not been completed since we have
not yet started development</p>

<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-89>

<br>
<h4>USER STORY 2</h4>
<p>As the head of department, I need to be able to compare the difficulty between
various modules, so that I can balance module difficulty across all modules.</p>

<br>
<h4>USER STORY 3</h4>
<p>As a personal tutor, I want to see statistics of individual student performance, so I
can see a students strengths and weaknesses and offer additional support to those 
modules.</p>

<br>
<h4>USER STORY 4</h4>
<p>As a professor, I want to be able to see the average performance of students in 
my module, so that I can assess whether my students are finding my lecture delivery
easy to understand.</p>

<p>This story had been assigned to the developer of the initial histogram graph and
has been completed as the MVP</p>

<br>
<h4>USER STORY 5</h4>
<p>As a personal tutor, I want to be able to keep a log of statistics produced
overtime, so that I can recall to earlier years' data graphs to form a consistent
comparison of the quality of a course and module.</p>

<br>
<h4>USER STORY 6</h4>
<p>As a head of department, I want to be able to see a comparison on the students' 
performance between different courses, so that I can assess which course students 
are finding the most difficult.</p>

<br>
<h1>FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</h1>
The program should read the provided dataset from IIT<br>
The program should convert the dataset into a report that can be easily interpreted<br>
The report should include statistics to identify student performance categorically 
(top, average and poor performers)<br>
The report should include a histogram for individual modules showing the distribution 
of the students marks<br>
The report should include statistics to identify the difficulty level of a module 
categorically (hard, moderate and easy modules)<br>
The report should contain scatter plots for various modules and fit a linear regression 
line for the data points in the scatter plot, the data points show the performance of a 
student in a particular module with respect to their average performance across all other 
modules<br>

<h1>NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</h1>
The program should be developed and coded in java<br>
The final report should be presented in a graphical user interface with visualizations of 
the data displayed on screen<br>
The graphical user interface should have intractable buttons for the user to choose how to 
process the dataset<br>


<h1>RISK ASSESSMENT</h1>
<br><p>Low attendance from project group members may cause workloads to be distributed unevenly. This
may hold up the development process of the deliverables to be completed on time.

Impact - Minor <br>
Likelihood - Possible

This risk has not yet been assigned to someone and has not had to be completed since we have yet
to encounter this documented risk.</p>
<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-90><br>

<br><p>Project group members may be less experienced in Java programming languages. This may mean the
development of the programs features and interface will be distributed based on the difficulty 
of the task meaning more difficult tasks are assigned to the stronger programmers of the team.

Impact - Minor <br>
Likelihood - Likely

This risk has not yet been assigned to someone and has not had to be completed since we have yet
to encounter this documented risk.</p>
<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-91><br>

<br><p>Scope creep may cause requirements of the deliverables to change mid-development of the product
which will dramatically reduce time attending to fulfilling additional requirements. To mitigate
the team should agree on the projects parameters from the very start to the end of the project
by sharing the same vision and keeping on track with regular meetings.

Impact - Major <br>
Likelihood - Possible

This risk has not yet been assigned to someone and has not had to be completed since we have yet
to encounter this documented risk.</p>
<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-92><br>

<br><p>Project scheduling time may take longer than initially expected delaying the timelines of tasks
impacting the delivery date and performance of our team. Underestimating the time it may take to
complete a task by a team member. To mitigate this risk we have applied the rule of thumb of
overestimating the time needed to complete a task through the use of a project gantt chart to
give us a birds eye view of the project timeline.

Impact - Moderate <br>
Likelihood - Likely

This risk has not yet been assigned to someone and has not had to be completed since we have yet
to encounter this documented risk.</p>
<https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201165-93><br>

<br><p>Miscommunication can cause a lack of clarity in the project scope can lead to unclear tasks, falling
behind on deadlines and below standard work which is difficult to uphold in person due to team 
members living very far away. To mitigate this we have made an effort to attend to as many team project
labs as well as communicating through social apps such as whatsapp in a group chat.

Impact - Major <br>
Likelihood - Possible

This risk has not yet been assigned to someone and has not had to be completed since we have yet
